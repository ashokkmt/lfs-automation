# 🚀 Linux From Scratch – Automated Build Scripts

This repository contains fully automated shell scripts for building a complete **Linux From Scratch (LFS)** system.   
These scripts simplify the entire LFS process — toolchain, chroot system, base packages, kernel, and GRUB setup — into reproducible automation. 

This project was developed as part of my **Operating Systems PBL – Custom Linux OS (LFS)**
